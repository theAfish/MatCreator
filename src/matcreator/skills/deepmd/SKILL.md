description: Deep potential models finetuning and testing using the DeePMD-kit.
  Use this skill whenever finetuning a Deep Potential (DPA-1 / DPA-2 / DPA-3 / DPA-4 / DPA-4c) model
  or running model tests on a dataset. The oldest DP descriptors such as se_e2_a, se_e2_r,
  and se_e3 are no longer supported. 
  Training from scratch is NEVER advised unless fine-tuning a DPA-4c model on data labeled by a fine-tuned model.
  Multitask fine-tuning is NOT supported.

# DeePMD-kit CLI (fine-tuning, testing)

Every operation to be performed with the deepmd-kit CLI, including fine-tuning and `dp test` testing,
should be divided into:
1. a **preparation** stage (including data conversion + input.json generation, should be performed locally);
2. an **execution** stage (executing dp CLI commands, local or via bohrium skill on Bohrium cloud).

| Stage       | Tool | Where                                              |
|-------------|---|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Prepare** | `deepmd_prepare.py` | always run locally                                 |
| **Execute** | `dp` CLI | run locally **or** submit remotely via bohrium skill |

Script: `deepmd_prepare.py` ([scripts/deepmd_prepare.py](scripts/deepmd_prepare.py)).
Use the `run_skill_script` tool to execute:
- `skill_name`: `"deepmd"`
- `script_name`: `"deepmd_prepare.py"`
- `args`: the sub-command and flags as a single string

The tool will resolve the script from the skill directory and runs it with `cwd` set to the
session working directory, so relative paths in arguments resolve correctly.


## Phase 1 — Preparation

`deepmd_prepare.py` converts raw structure files into `deepmd/npy` format. In preparation of fine-tuning tasks,
it also copies (or symlinks) the base model and writes `input.json` ready for `dp train`.

It always runs locally and requires `ase`, `dpdata`, and `numpy`.

Check reference [references/supported_deepmd_models.md](references/supported_deepmd_models.md) of this skill
carefully for details of available DPA models, variants and their usage.

Each sub-command prints a summary message in json format through logging.logger that includes the exact `dp` execution
command to use in Phase 2. The message will start with something like `"CLI execution summary:..."`.

Use subcommand `prepare-finetune` for fine-tuning, `prepare-test` for testing.

If you are not sure about the arguments, try `deepmd_prepare.py --help` or `deepmd_prepare.py <subcommand> --help`
before running.

> **Notice:**
> 1. Unless absolutely necessary, **keep all optional arguments at their default values**. Default model parameters
> and training parameters, etc.
> Set only the required ones, including choice of model and variant, path to model file, specification of data, etc.
> 2. **Remote submission:** The base model must be a regular file (not a symlink) inside
> `<workdir>` for dpdispatcher to upload it. NEVER use symlinks when performing remote submission!

Expected contents of `<workdir>` after preparation can be found in the docs and help message of `deepmd_prepare.py`.


## Phase 2 — Execution

### Local execution
All commands must run from **inside the workdir** (`cd <workdir>`).
Run the command as returned in Phase 1's summary message.


### Remote submission to Bohrium (**preferred**)

The primary submission method uses the `bohrium` skill (`bohr` CLI). Refer to the skill `bohrium` for details.

### Handling long jobs
For time-consuming fine-tuning jobs, you can wrap the submission + polling in `tmux`:
```bash
tmux new-session -d -s deepmd_train "bash -c '...submit+poll commands...'"
tmux ls
```


### Restarting an interrupted run

```bash
dp --pt train input.json --restart model.ckpt.pt
```

> **Notice:** 
> 1. The restart command must be run from the workdir.
> 2. When resuming a Bohrium run, you must first download the bohrium output, copy model.ckpt.pt to the workdir,
>    and then resubmit with the restart command.
> 3. For a **DPA-4c** run, use `dp --pt-expt train input.json --restart model.ckpt.pt` instead
>    of `--pt train` — DPA-4c requires `--pt-expt` for every backend (see the DPA-4c section).

## Model inspection
You can inspect the available model heads/branches and descriptor parameters using `dp show`, either before
or after usage, if necessary.

```bash
# List available heads/branches (multi-task model)
dp show <model_file> model-branch

# Inspect descriptor parameters
dp show <model_file> descriptor
```

# DPA-4c fine-tuning

Fine-tuning a DPA-4c model from a fine-tuned model is the only scenario where
training a model is advised (see the description of this skill). The architecture
for fine-tuning is **DPA-4c** (`descriptor.type = "dpa4c"`), whose CLI usage differs
from regular fine-tuning.

> **Prerequisite gate:** fine-tuning requires the concept-level Stage A (NPT MD
> exploration) and Stage B (inference labeling) to be completed first — see the
> `machine-learning-force-field` skill ([SKILL.md](../concepts/machine-learning-force-field/SKILL.md)).
> Training directly on the seed/static structures is forbidden.

The concrete DPA-4c training command and the recommended Bohrium image/machine are documented in
[references/supported_deepmd_models.md](references/supported_deepmd_models.md) ("DPA-4c" section).

**DPA-4c preparation is integrated into `deepmd_prepare.py` — do NOT write the DPA-4c input.json
by hand.** Use the same Phase 1 `prepare-finetune` sub-command with:
- `--model_name dpa4c` and `--model_variant` one of `air` / `neo` / `mini` / `nano` / `plus`;
- `--input_model_path` pointing to the matching official DPA-4c pretrained checkpoint
  (`DPA4C-<Variant>-OMat24-v20260819.pt`, downloadable from AIS Square — see the models reference).

The script embeds the official per-variant DPA-4c templates (default 50 epochs), writes `input.json`,
and prints the exact Phase 2 execution command, which trains via
`dp --pt-expt train input.json --init-model <model> --skip-neighbor-stat --use-pretrain-script --output output.json`
and then freezes / compresses / tests with `--pt-expt` as well.
`--use-pretrain-script` loads the model section from the checkpoint's own script (guards against
future DPA-4c template drift); `--output output.json` records the normalized parameters actually
used — **keep `output.json` as a record of the run**.

After training, freeze the model and then compress the frozen model for deployment.
**Every DPA-4c CLI backend must use `--pt-expt` (train, freeze, compress, test) — never `--pt`.**
The standard `--pt` (PyTorch) backend produces wrong forces + virials/pressure and crashes on
the DPA-4c `sel=[999999]` selection, so it is forbidden for DPA-4c in any stage:

```bash
dp --pt-expt freeze -c model.ckpt.pt -o frozen
dp --pt-expt compress -i frozen.pt2 -o compressed_model.pt2
```

> The `--pt-expt compress` step is specific to DPA-4c; it reduces the frozen model
> size for inference. `dp ... freeze -o frozen` writes `frozen.pt2` (the backend
> appends `.pt2`), which `compress` then reads via `-i frozen.pt2`. See the
> "Freeze to `.pt2`" section below for general freeze details.

# DeePMD-kit python interface (ASE calculator)

Deepmd-kit provides a Python interface, which can act as an ASE calculator, further enabling any calculation task
supported by ASE. A quick example:

```python
from ase import Atoms
from deepmd.calculator import DP

calc = DP(model="<model_file>", head="<some_head>")
water = Atoms(
    "H2O",
    positions=[(0.7601, 1.9270, 1), (1.9575, 1, 1), (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)],
    cell=[100, 100, 100],
    calculator=calc,
)
print(water.get_potential_energy())
print(water.get_forces())
print(water.get_stress())
```

Here, the `model_file` can be both a `.pt` checkpoint file or a `.pth`/`.pt2` frozen model. Choose head
only for multi-head pretrained models (DPA-2, DPA-3). No need to specify head for models with no head or
fine-tuned model.

Details about this interface is documented in the
[Deepmd-kit documentation (ASE integration)](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/stable/third-party/ase.html).

# DeePMD-kit lammps interface

Deepmd-kit provides a LAMMPS interface, which can be used in LAMMPS simulations. A quick example:

```bash
pair_style deepmd <model_file>
pair_coeff * * <element_1> <element_2> ...
```

Here, the `model_file` must be a `.pth`/`.pt2` frozen model. No checkpoint `.pt` file allowed.
The order of `element_1`, `element_2`, ... must strictly match the atom types used in the
LAMMPS simulation input file and the simulation box. For example, if the lammps simulation box
has `type 1 = H`, `type 2 = O`, then the pair_coeff line should be `pair_coeff * * H O`.

> For DPA-4 and DPA-4c models: **`atom_modify map yes` is required before the `pair_style deepmd` line in the lammps input file.**
> The `.pt2` graph inference relies on an explicit ghost/periodic-image to local-atom map;
> the model fails fast without it!

Multi-GPU (MPI) inference: launch one MPI rank per GPU. An example on a 4-GPU machine:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 mpirun -np 4 lmp -in in.lammps
```

Details about this interface is documented in the
[Deepmd-kit documentation (lammps integration)](https://docs.deepmodeling.com/projects/deepmd/en/stable/third-party/lammps-command.html).

# Fast Inference techniques

## Freeze to `.pt2` (for DPA-4)

The frozen `.pt2` is an AOTInductor archive used for inference (ASE, LAMMPS).

```
dp --pt freeze -c <model_file> -o frozen
```

The PyTorch backend detects DPA4/SeZM and writes `frozen.pt2`.

> **The `.pt2` is target-specific** — it depends on host CPU/GPU, GPU compute
> capability, and libtorch version. Freeze on the target machine rather than
> reusing a `.pt2` across different hardware.

## Inference precision environment variables

**Precision is fixed at freeze time.** Set these before running `dp --pt freeze`:

| Variable          | Default       | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DP_TF32_INFER`   | `0` (highest) | float32 matmul precision: `0` highest, `1` high, `2` medium. Keep `0` for MD and PES-smoothness-sensitive workflows.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `DP_TRITON_INFER` | `0`           | Fused Triton inference kernels (CUDA), cumulative: `0` off; `1` universal kernels; `2` adds table-tuned SO(2) value-path kernels; `3` adds fp16 tensor-core mixing GEMMs. Levels `0`–`2` keep full float32 accumulation; `3` gives large speedup with negligible accuracy impact. |

Accepted boolean values: `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` and `0`/`false`/`no`/`off`.

The script [scripts/deepmd_prepare.py](scripts/deepmd_prepare.py) will automatically freeze with the above defaults after fine-tuning,
when `--freeze` argument is passed.

If not satisfied with the defaults, do not use the resulting `.pt2` file after fine-tuning,
but instead freeze your own model with the desired settings from `model.ckpt.pt`.

## Constraints

**Environment & dependencies:** 
- `deepmd_prepare.py` requires `ase`, `dpdata`, and `numpy` in the local Python environment.

**Data & model:**
- All input structures must be **labelled** (having energy + forces + virial, either by DFT or by a fine-tuned model). 
  Unlabeled structures raise an error during dpdata export.
- Base model for finetuning must be a `.pt` checkpoint file. **Frozen models cannot be fine-tuned.**
- Model variant and input parameters must match exactly — do not mix across variants.
- **`type_map` is fixed to the full periodic table (H–Og).** DPA models uses type embeddings
  indexed by this map; do NOT attempt to change it, and do not restrict it to dataset elements.
- `deepmd/npy` systems are written per chemical formula; use `--mixed_type` for variable
  composition within a single directory (but often not necessary).

**Backend limitations:**
- **No support beyond pytorch implementation**: the tensorflow, jax and paddle-paddle backends are not supported.
- **Check GPU and image compatibility carefully**: as documented in reference
    [references/supported_deepmd_models.md](references/supported_deepmd_models.md).
    Choosing wrong GPU or image may lead to unexpected errors.
