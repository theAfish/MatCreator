"""Provider-neutral adapter protocol for the remote-job control plane.

``RemoteJobStore`` and ``RemoteJobService`` are already provider-neutral (see
``remote_jobs.py``): the persisted schema, lifecycle state machine, and
recovery bookkeeping all key off a generic ``provider`` string. This module
defines the boundary a *new* provider must implement so that
``RemoteJobService`` never needs provider-specific branches — adding a
provider means adding one adapter module plus one registration call (see
``registry.py``), nothing else in the control plane changes.
